# 🧪 Playwright Automation Framework – Advantage Online Shopping

## 👋 Overview

This repository contains a **production-grade end-to-end automation test framework** built using **Playwright with TypeScript**, designed to validate critical user journeys on the Advantage Online Shopping demo e‑commerce application:

🔗 **Application Under Test (AUT):** [https://www.advantageonlineshopping.com/](https://www.advantageonlineshopping.com/)

The framework is architected following **top 1% automation engineering standards**, emphasizing:

* Clean **Page Object Model (POM)** design
* Reliable and deterministic test execution
* Realistic user behavior simulation
* Maintainability, scalability, and CI/CD readiness

---

## 🎯 Test Objectives Covered

The automated suite validates the following core customer journeys:

1. **User Management**

   * Create a new user account
   * Login with valid credentials
   * Logout successfully
   * Validate error handling for invalid login attempts

2. **E‑Commerce Purchase Flow**

   * Add a product to the cart
   * Start checkout as a logged‑out user (redirect to login)
   * Complete checkout as a logged‑in user
   * Complete direct payment flow using SafePay

### 🔑 Design Principles Applied

* **Strict POM separation** (No assertions inside tests leaking into page layers)
* **Single responsibility** per page class
* **Resilient locators** (role-based & attribute-based selectors)
* **Explicit assertions** for navigation, visibility, and state validation
* **Chromium-first execution** as per requirement

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

* **Node.js** ≥ 18.x
* **npm** ≥ 9.x
* **Git**

Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd MOZILOR
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

This will install **Chromium**, which is the configured execution browser.

---

## ▶️ Test Execution

### 🔹 Run All Tests (Headless)

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### 🔹 Run Tests in Headed Mode

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### 🔹 Run a Specific Test Case

```bash
npx playwright test tests/TC_001_Create_a_new_user_account.test.ts
```

### 🔹 Run with Debug Mode

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

---

## 📊 Test Reports

After execution, Playwright generates a rich HTML report.

### View Report

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

📁 Reports are stored under:

* `playwright-report/`
* `test-results/`

---

## 🔐 Test Data Strategy

* **Static test credentials** are used for demo stability
* User creation uses deterministic data (can be enhanced with UUID/randomization if required)
* Payment flow uses **SafePay sandbox credentials** only

> ⚠️ Since this is a public demo site, occasional instability is expected. Timeouts and assertions are tuned accordingly.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Best Practices Followed

✔ Page Object Model (POM)
✔ Explicit waits with meaningful assertions
✔ Zero hard sleeps (`waitForTimeout` avoided)
✔ Readable, business‑aligned test names
✔ CI/CD friendly (Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions ready)
✔ Scalable structure for future test expansion

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Readiness (Optional)

This framework can be easily integrated with:

* **GitHub Actions**
* **Azure DevOps Pipelines**
* **Jenkins**

Chromium-only execution ensures fast and deterministic CI runs.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Author Notes

This framework is built with a **senior SDET / Automation Architect mindset**, focusing on:

* Real-world automation standards
* Interview‑ready design
* Enterprise‑grade maintainability

If this were extended further, next enhancements would include:

* Test data factories
* API‑UI hybrid setup
* Environment config layers
* Parallel test sharding
